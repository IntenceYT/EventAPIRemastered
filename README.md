This is an API used for handleing events across your java based projects.

It's meant to be simple to use without sacrificing performance and extensibility.

Currently the API is in alpha phase and alot needs to be fixed/improve. If you have any suggestion for improvements/fixes for shit, feel free to make a pull request.
